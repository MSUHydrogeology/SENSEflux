# Introduction
The SENSEflux (Spatially Explicit Nutrient Source Estimate and Flux) model uses a GIS and mass balance approach to simulate nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) fate and transport from point and nonpoint sources across the landscapethrough rivers to lakes and wetlands. It includes four components: (1) nutrient applications, (2) in situ losses, (3) basin attenuation through surface and subsurface pathways, and (4) stream and lake attenuation.
